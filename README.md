The codes go into the folder raw_codes and work only for python code.

The format of the code is {exam}\_{question}\_{X} where X is an integer. The last 3 digits are the identification number of the person, just make sure they are all unique. X / 1000 represents the score of the code. the {exam} and {question}, you can ignore them and assign a random variable to it if you wish

To modify the cutoff of the good/poor code, modify the treshold variable in classify_neural_network.py
